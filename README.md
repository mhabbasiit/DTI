# Description
This repository contains python code to perform processing of Diffusion MRI data. At present, the only distortion correction supported is topup correction which require an extra reversed polarity acquisition

# Prerequisites

* FSL (https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/)
* ANTs (https://github.com/ANTsX/ANTs)
* Dipy (https://docs.dipy.org/stable/user_guide/installation) 

# Steps

1. Topup Correction:
2. Eddy Correction:
3. Brain Extraction:
4. Merging of Acquisitions (Optional, if the session is split into multiple scans):
5. DTI Model Fitting:
6. Registration to MNI Space using Rigid + Affine transformation:
7. Quality control of final output:
