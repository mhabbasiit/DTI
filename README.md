# Diffusion MRI Preprocessing Pipeline

This repository contains Python code to perform preprocessing of diffusion MRI (dMRI) data.  
At present, the only distortion correction supported is **top-up correction**, which requires an additional reversed polarity acquisition.  

---

## Prerequisites

- [FSL](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/)  
- [ANTs](https://github.com/ANTsX/ANTs)  
- [DIPY](https://docs.dipy.org/stable/user_guide/installation)

## Configuration

Paths and file naming are controlled by `config.py`.  

All scripts work on a **subject-by-subject** basis.

## Processing Steps

### 1. Topup Correction — `b0_correction.py`
Correct susceptibility-induced distortions using FSL TOPUP (Andersson et al., 2003).  
This step estimates a field map from images with opposite phase-encoding directions and applies it to unwarp distorted diffusion volumes.

### 2. Eddy Current and Motion Correction — `process_eddy.py`
Correct distortions caused by eddy currents and subject motion using FSL EDDY (Andersson & Sotiropoulos, 2016).  
Includes slice-to-volume correction and outlier replacement.  

Steps performed:
1. Load and merge diffusion-weighted images (AP/PA or reversed polarity)
2. Prepare acquisition parameters and B0 indices
3. Run FSL EDDY with slice-to-volume correction (optional)
4. Generate QC images comparing original vs corrected volumes

### 3. Brain Extraction — `brain_extraction.py`
Removes non-brain tissue from diffusion MRI data using FSL BET 
(Smith, 2002). This step performs skull stripping and generates 
quality control (QC) images and summary files to validate 
the extracted brain.

Steps performed:
1. Apply FSL BET to remove non-brain tissue
2. Generate brain mask and masked output
3. Compute brain volume (ml) and validate against the expected range
4. Create QC images (raw, brain-extracted, raw+mask, differences)
5. Write QC summary (CSV) for downstream review

### 4. Merging of Acquisitions — `reg_within_fsl.py`

Aligns and merges multiple diffusion MRI runs using FSL FLIRT in case a session is broken down into multiple acquisitions.
Rigid transformations are estimated between B0 reference images,
applied to corresponding diffusion volumes, and propagated to
b-vectors to ensure orientation consistency across runs.
Steps performed:
1. Register B0 images between runs using FLIRT rigid-body transform
2. Apply transforms to diffusion volumes (DWI)
3. Rotate b-vectors using the computed transformation matrix
4. Merge registered DWI volumes, b-vectors, and b-values
5. Save combined outputs for downstream processing

---

### 5. Registration to MNI Space — `run_reg_mni.py`
Registers diffusion images to the MNI152 template using a
two-step approach with FSL FLIRT (rigid + affine). Corresponding
b-vectors are rotated to preserve orientation
consistency. The pipeline also applies the transforms to the diffusion
volumes and masks, and prepares final outputs for downstream analysis.

Steps performed:
1. Register B0 to MNI (rigid, 6 DOF), save the matrix and registered B0
2. Refine B0→MNI with affine (12 DOF), save matrix, and registered B0
3. Apply rigid and then affine transforms to DWI
4. Rotate b-vectors using the previously computed transformations
5. Copy b-values (bval_final.bval) for consistency
6. Register mask with nearest-neighbour interpolation using the previously computed transformations 

---

### 6. Diffusion Tensor Model Fitting — `run_dtifit_dipy.py`
Fits a diffusion tensor model using DIPY (Garyfallidis et al., 2014).
This script takes preprocessed diffusion MRI data (DWI, bvec, bval, mask)
and outputs standard DTI-derived measures including fractional anisotropy (FA),
mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD).
Eigenvectors of the tensor are also saved for visualization.
Steps performed:
1. Load diffusion MRI data, b-values, b-vectors, and brain mask
2. Construct gradient table using DIPY
3. Fit the diffusion tensor model voxel-wise
4. Extract tensor components (Dxx, Dxy, Dxz, Dyy, Dyz, Dzz)
5. Save DTI-derived tensor components and maps: FA, MD, RD, AD, and eigenvectors (V1, V2, V3)
6. Generate QC images showing a color FA map

### 7. Quality Control of Final Outputs — `run_final_qc.py`
Performs automated, session-aware QC checks on diffusion pipeline outputs.
This script validates file existence and assesses registration quality using
overlap metrics (Dice) between warped images and the MNI template. Results are
written to per-session CSV reports for downstream review.

What it checks:
1) File existence validation (key outputs, matrices, QC images)
2) Registration to MNI (rigid + affine) — Dice coefficient vs. MNI template
3) Within-session registration (if NUM_SCANS_PER_SESSION > 1) — Dice on b0-to-b0
4) Session discovery and per-session reporting
5) Structured logging to file + console

Outputs (CSV per subject/session):
- QC/file_existance.csv
- QC/within_subject_registraction_qc.csv              (only if NUM_SCANS_PER_SESSION > 1)
- QC/mni_registraction_qc.csv

Notes:
- Uses thresholds for PASS/WARNING based on Dice (configurable in code).
- Relies on TEMPLATE_PATH and derivative folders from config.py.
- Designed to run after registration steps have completed.

### 8. Generation of HTML QC Reports — `dti_qc.py`
Generates automated, subject-level QC reports that summarize and visualize the
outputs of the DTI preprocessing pipeline. This script *reads existing* QC CSVs
and QC images from each step and compiles them into a clickable HTML report 
along with CSV/JSON summaries. If FA/MD maps are available, it also computes 
basic statistics.

Summarized in the report:
- Raw vs. corrected B0 (Topup) — QC images (before/after)
- Eddy-corrected vs. uncorrected volumes — QC images
- Brain extraction evaluation — mask overlays + brain volume (mL)
- FA and color-FA maps — quick-look thumbnails and stats
- Registration metrics — Dice coefficients for within-session & MNI steps

Inputs (read-only):
- Existing QC CSVs (e.g., `file_existance.csv`,
  `within_subject_registraction_qc.csv`, `mni_registraction_qc.csv`)
- QC images from each step (Topup, Skull stripping, Eddy, DTI fit)
- Optional DTI maps: `dipy_fa.nii.gz`, `dipy_md.nii.gz`
- Paths and flags from `config.py` (e.g., `OUTPUT_DIR`, `NUM_SCANS_PER_SESSION`)

Outputs:
- Per-subject JSON:  `<QC>/<subject_id>/<subject_id>_qc_results.json`
- Per-subject CSV:   `<QC>/<subject_id>/<subject_id>_qc_summary.csv`
- Per-subject HTML:  `<QC>/<subject_id>/<subject_id>_report.html`
- Aggregated CSV:    `<QC>/all_subjects_summary.csv`
- Aggregated HTML:   `<QC>/DTI_QC_Summary.html`

Behavior & notes:
- Session-aware: if session directories exist (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD), they are 
  automatically detected and linked.
- Read-only summarization; heavy QC computations (e.g., Dice) are performed 
  in earlier scripts.
- If `nilearn` is not available, visualization sections are safely skipped.
- Uses the non-interactive Matplotlib backend (`Agg`) to run in headless 
  environments.
